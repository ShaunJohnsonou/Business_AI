Halo vriende. 

1. Clone the repo:
   Open a directory in your chosen IDE that you would like to store all your files in.
   Go to the terminal and run the command:
   git clone https://github.com/ShaunJohnsonou/Business_AI.git

2. Create a virtual environment (kind of optional)
3. Run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' from the terminal while you are in the same location as your requirements.txt file.
4. ... That's it.
